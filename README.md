## Description

This repository contains a list of phone numbers commonly associated with unsolicited calls (telemarketing, scams, unwanted surveys) targeting individuals in Switzerland. Each entry includes the phone number, the identified company name (often listed as "unbekannt" meaning "unknown"), and sometimes a brief remark ("Bemerkung") in German describing the nature of the call (e.g., health insurance offers, wine sales, supposed Microsoft support calls, lottery scams).

The data appears to be a manually compiled list intended for identification or blocking purposes.

## Data Format
